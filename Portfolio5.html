                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p class = desc1>The performance of any computer system is determined by a number of essential components, but some are given more attention than others. Often referred to as the computer's heart, the motherboard is essential to connecting and coordinating all other parts so that they may work and interact with one another (Tomljanovic & Krelja, 2013). Despite its significance, users frequently overlook it in favor of CPUs, memory, and storage, making it one of the most overlooked components of computer hardware. However, the motherboard is a crucial component of any system since its quality and design have a direct impact on the computer's functionality, stability, and upgrading possibilities (BasuMallick, 2024a).</p>
                        <p class = desc2>There are numerous types of motherboards, each intended to fulfill particular requirements and work with various system setups. The type of motherboard chosen can have a significant impact on a computer's capabilities and future upgrades, ranging from huge, feature-rich boards perfect for high-performance configurations to small models appropriate for space-saving installations (Coppock, 2022). Since every motherboard kind has distinct benefits and drawbacks, it is crucial to comprehend these varieties in order to construct a system that is appropriate for its intended function.</p>

                        <h3>Discussion</h3>
                        <p class = desc1>The form factor of a motherboard is a crucial feature in determining its overall size as well as compatibility with computer cases, power supplies, and other peripherals (Mueller, 2012). The motherboard's physical attributes, such as its measurements, mounting hole locations, and component arrangement, are referred to as the form factor. It determines whether the motherboard can fit into a case and whether it can hold expansion cards, graphics cards, and storage devices, among other essential hardware components (C&T Solution, 2024). Different form factors influence the overall design and capabilities of the computer system by providing differing degrees of flexibility and expandability.</p>
