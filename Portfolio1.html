                        <p class = desc1>It is the study of computers and computations, as well as the invention of algorithms and techniques (Bourke, 2018).</p>
                        <p class = desc2>This discipline not only focuses on theoretical aspects but also on practical applications that solve real-world challenges across various domains.</p>
                        <p class = desc3>The discipline of computer science was born in the early 1940s that comprises the knowledge and methods used by computing professionals, involving their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application (Denning, 1999a).</p>
