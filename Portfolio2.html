                        <p class = desc2><b>></b> It exists in different formats, such as, numbers, characters, symbols, visuals, sounds, and measures (Zemmouchi-Ghomari, 2021). It is frequently utilized in research and corporate settings to support conclusions and influence strategic decisions.</p>
                        <p class = desc3><b>></b> Data has no meaning. They gain meaning only when appropriated by a human recipient (Sanders, 2016).</p>

                        <p class = desc1>Information consists of meaningful symbols or signs that can lead to the creation of knowledge. It is data with context and significance (Zins, 2007).</p>
                        <p class = desc2>It serves to reduce uncertainty by providing insights, facts, and understanding that help individuals make informed decisions and gain knowledge.</p>
                        <p class = desc3>Cambridge International Examinations (2015) state that information is the end product of data processing. This produces facts, allowing the processed data to be used in context and with meaning. </p>
