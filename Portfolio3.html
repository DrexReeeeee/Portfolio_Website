                        <p class = desc1><b>> </b>Number systems are foundational concepts in mathematics, providing a framework for representing and manipulating numerical quantities (Floyd, 2015).</p>
                        <p class = desc2><b>> </b>They are useful in digital computers and the knowledge of these systems is necessary to perform reliable, economic and easily under stable arithmetic operations.</p>
                        <p class = desc3><b>> </b>Number systems are also known as positional number systems since the value of each symbol (i.e., digit and alphabet) in a number is determined by its position within the number (NCERT, 2024).</p>

                             <p class = desc3><b>> </b>A binary numeral is a sequence of binary digits, called bits. Each bit position is multiplied by a power of 2 (Weiss, 2006).</p>
                            <p class = desc3><b>> </b>In binary, the column weights ( from right to left) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, and so on. If you work with binary numbers often, you’ll save time if you remember these powers of two up to 2^16 (Buchanan, 1997).</p>
